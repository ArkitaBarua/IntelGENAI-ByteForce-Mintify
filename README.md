# Indie Artists NFT Marketplace - My Garden Feature ðŸŒ¿

This project is an NFT marketplace tailored for indie artists. The marketplace allows artists to upload their artwork, convert it into NFTs, and participate in a gamified feature called **"My Garden"**, centered around **NFT picture cards** known as "Plants."

## Overview

Indie Artists NFT Marketplace is built to support indie creators and provide a gamified ecosystem for NFT enthusiasts. Our **My Garden** feature allows users to grow, nurture, and interact with **NFT plants** that are dynamically linked to a **Carbon Credit (CC)** system. These plants have specific attributes such as **health, sustenance**, and **regeneration factors**, which fluctuate based on CC usage.

## Features

### Core Marketplace Features
- Artists can upload artwork with a **name, description**, and **price**.
- Art is converted into NFTs using **Ethereum-based smart contracts**.
- **Carbon credits (CCs)** act as gas fees for transactions on the platform.

### "My Garden" Gamified NFT Plants
1. **AI-Generated Plant Art**: Plant NFTs are generated by an AI model.
2. **Plant Attributes**:
    - **Sustenance Factor**: Impacts health loss when CCs are spent.
    - **Regeneration Factor**: Influences monthly health recovery.
    - **Health**: Based on total remaining carbon credits.
    - **Plant Name**: Custom names for each plant.
3. **Plant Lifecycle**: Plants live for **18 months**, then "die" and become static digital art.
4. **Health & Value Calculations**: Dynamic plant value adjustments based on health, CC spending, and regeneration.

### Gamification Enhancements
- Users are rewarded for maintaining high **Garden Health**.
- Dead plants still contribute to the regeneration system.
- **Post-death visual changes** indicate a plant's deceased status.

### Suggested Improvements:
- **Reward System**: Users receive exclusive NFTs/badges for maintaining high garden health.
- **Community Garden**: Users can form groups to maintain a collective garden with shared rewards.
- **Environmental Impact Tracking**: Track the carbon footprint and CC usage on the platform.
- **Dynamic Plant Attributes**: Random events or seasonal changes impact plant stats temporarily.

## Technologies

### Frontend
- **React.js**: Component-based UI for marketplace and "My Garden" feature.
- **Web3.js**: Blockchain interaction for NFT creation and transactions.
- **Axios**: API calls to the backend.

### Backend
- **Node.js**: Backend server.
- **Express.js**: API routing and logic for managing artwork, plants, and transactions.
- **MongoDB**: Database to store user profiles, plants, and transaction logs.
- **Solidity**: Smart contracts for NFT minting, carbon credit management, and plant lifecycle.
- **Python**: AI integration for plant image generation.

### AI Integration
- **Python Model**: AI-generated plant art is created via a Python model and uploaded via API.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: v16+
- **MongoDB**: Installed and running.
- **Truffle**: For compiling and deploying smart contracts.
- **Python**: v3.8+ for AI image generation.

### Frontend
1. Navigate to `/frontend`:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    npm start
    ```

### Backend
1. Navigate to `/backend`:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```

### Smart Contracts
1. Navigate to `/smart-contracts` and compile the contracts:
    ```bash
    truffle compile
    truffle migrate
    ```

### AI Model Integration
1. Navigate to `/ai` and set up the Python environment:
    ```bash
    cd ai
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Run the script to generate plant images:
    ```bash
    python generatePlantArt.py
    ```

## Smart Contracts

### NFTMarketplace.sol
Handles the minting and trading of NFTs on the marketplace.

### CarbonCredit.sol
Manages the carbon credit system, used as gas fees for transactions.

### PlantLifecycle.sol
Governs plant lifecycles, including health and value calculations, regeneration, and death logic.

## AI Model Integration

The AI model generates plant images dynamically based on predefined attributes. The AI-generated images are then uploaded to the backend via an API and stored on IPFS for decentralization.

- **Script**: `generatePlantArt.py`
- **API Endpoint**: `/uploadPlantImage`

## Database Structure

```json
{
    "name": "string",
    "walletAddress": "string",
    "plants": [PlantSchema],
    "artworks": [ArtworkSchema],
    "carbonCredits": "number"
}
```

    "health": "number",
    "value": "number",
    "lifecycleStatus": "string"   // e.g., 'alive', 'dead'
}
```

### Transaction Schema
Tracks transactions on the platform.
```json
